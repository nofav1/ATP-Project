# ðŸ§© Maze Generator â€“ Client-Server Java Application

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a **client-server architecture in Java**, focusing on the **generation and manipulation of mazes**. It demonstrates advanced programming concepts such as:

- **Design patterns**
- **Multithreading**
- **Client-server communication**

The goal is to build a dynamic application that can generate mazes, handle multiple client requests, and demonstrate efficient data processing.

## ðŸ§± Project Components

### 1. ðŸ”§ Maze Generation
- Utilizes the **Decorator Design Pattern** to support flexible implementation of various maze generation algorithms.
- Supports generation of different maze types based on user input or predefined parameters.

### 2. ðŸ”Œ Client-Server Communication
- A **Java server** listens for incoming client requests, processes them by generating mazes, and returns results.
- Communication is managed via input/output streams to ensure smooth and efficient data exchange.

### 3. ðŸ§µ Multithreading
- The server handles **multiple client connections concurrently** using Java threads.
- This ensures high performance and responsiveness under heavy load.

### 4. âœ… Testing
- Includes a suite of **JUnit tests** to validate:
  - Maze generation logic
  - Client-server communication
- Ensures reliability and correctness of core functionalities.
